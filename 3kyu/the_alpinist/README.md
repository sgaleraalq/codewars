# [**Path Finder #3: the Alpinist**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/576986639772456f6f00030c/python)

## **Task**
You are at start location ```[0, 0]``` in mountain area of NxN and you can only move in one of the four cardinal directions (i.e. North, East, South, West). Return minimal number of ```climb rounds``` to target location ```[N-1, N-1]```. Number of ```climb rounds``` between adjacent locations is defined as difference of location altitudes (ascending or descending).

Location altitude is defined as an integer number (0-9).
